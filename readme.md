## Image Classification

### Aim:

Your task is to train a neural network model on the provided training data and reach the maximum accuracy you can achieve. Dataset consists of 2400 total images distributed across the training, validation and test set.
The dataset link is present [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TdUIhRxjPtfg9sL1wN0qy37m9ieYzfOL/view). Dataset consists of 3 folders Training, Validation and Testing which have 6 different classes:

### Submission Guidelines:
The submission should consist of the following:

-   A test.csv file with two columns File_Path and Class. Format and test images you will find in the [csv zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e827fAszvrbkhWsENvmRQUxLKNtA7S_1/view) under the name of test_set.csv.
-   Link to your colab or kaggle notebook.
-   Link to your model.

## Rules:
- Participants must only use the provided training dataset.
- Submission should be in proper format as described in the Submission Guidelines.
- Manually changing the submission csv test.csv by using any image comparison technique can lead to your disqualification without any notice.
